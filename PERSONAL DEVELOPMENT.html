                        Accountability, humility, discipline I can see a number of ways in which
                        these characteristics are currently influencing my life.<br>
                        For starters, I'm not one to brag about my successes or what 
                        I have in on social media, and I rarely share personal information 
                        unless it's specifically requested, so humility is a virtue of mine. 
                        My family members and friends, to be honest, are unaware of my future objectives
                        and some achievements in life since I believe it is needless to discuss them and
                        for society to know, and I prefer to keep my ambitionsprivate and personal to me. Many
                        people ask me for life counsel, which I find strange because I do not consider myself to
                        be the wisest person. Even my mother has come to me to chat about her problems at work, and
                        she has always agreed with the counsel I have given her, despite the fact that I appear mediocre
                        at offering advice.
                        <br><br>
                        Secondly  accountability is important in my current life since I am an individual performer who expects
                        to be held accountable for my results, therefore I aim to do everything perfectly. I try to be a trustworthy
                        person who is known for correctness and precision in completing projects, whether they are homework assignments,
                        laboratories, or just everyday events, throughout my schoolwork and interactions with friends. I also like having
                        more control and responsibility, therefore I frequently accept extra responsibilities, especially when working in
                        groups, without being particularly thrilled because it gives me more leadership and accountability. My future objective
                        is aided by the knowledge that I am strong in responsibilities.
                        <br><br>
                        My third strength is discipline, which is useful in my current situation because I am constantly writing lists, keeping
                        an agenda, and attempting to plan for all of the duties that I am taking on. Also, when it comes to academics, I am happy
                        for deadlines since they help me organize my daily duties. I also utilize discipline to make things more efficient by employing
                        daily routines to help me complete projects with attention to detail. Using my discipline, I tend to squander less time, allowing
                        me to devote more time to the people, events, and organizations that I find fascinating and that require my attention. Discipline 
                        helps me achieve one of my future goals of remaining organized and efficient.
